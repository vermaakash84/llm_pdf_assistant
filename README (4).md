## 📚 LLM PDF Research Assistant

**Goal:** Ask questions from large collections of PDF documents and get AI-generated responses using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach.

### 📁 Project Structure

```
llm_pdf_assistant/
├── app.py                # Streamlit UI with batch toggle support
├── requirements.txt      # Required packages
├── db_batch_1/           # Vector store for batch 1 (auto-generated by Chroma)
├── db_batch_2/           # Vector store for batch 2
├── ...                   # More batches can be added
```

### ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

- **LangChain** (chains, document loaders, retrievers)
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (LLM backend: FLAN-T5)
- **ChromaDB** (local vector database)
- **PyMuPDF** (for PDF parsing)
- **Streamlit** (for UI deployment)

---

### 🤖 How It Works

1. PDFs are split into chunks (1000 tokens with 200 overlap).
2. Each chunk is converted into embeddings using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
3. Chunks are stored in ChromaDB.
4. User query is embedded and matched with top-k relevant chunks.
5. Retrieved text is passed to a Hugging Face LLM (FLAN-T5) for answer generation.
